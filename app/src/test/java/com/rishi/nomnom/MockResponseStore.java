My friend and I asked to be seated outside - and were - at a 4-top. Moments later, the manager came out and looked down his nose at us and wanted to know if we had just walked off the street and seated ourselves at this table.  He walked away when we told him the hostess had seated us there.  My friend ordered a dirty martini.  There was NOTHING dirty about it and my friend said it was horrible.  I told our server that we wanted to have a quick drink and a quick app bc we were on our way to a meeting.  He sneered at me and said that would not be possible as Zuni is not that kind of restaurant.  When we were leaving, my friend (who is a chef) asked for the manager's business card and was told there were no cards available.  GET OVER YOURSELVES ALREADY!!  You've lost a long-time guest and there are soooo many other, better restaurants in SF that I highly recommend people look elsewhere for a more original menu and staff that WANT to serve their guests.\",\n" +

They stopped serving Coke or Pepsi and now schlep some gross \\\"locally sourced\\\" boutique cola (per the waiter). But label says NY!!! But they do get to charge $5 for it. :(\\nI now always try to go buy a Coke across the street at the little market and bring it with me....and make a point of asking for a glass of ice for it in Zuni. Please bring Coke back and stop trying to be foodie PC.\",\n" +

Service is fairly slow and the roast chicken (as disclosed) takes a full 60 minutes to make. I felt at the end that the experience was not bad, just not the worth the cost and time spent.\",\n" +
